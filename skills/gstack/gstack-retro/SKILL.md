> **Tandem vendoring note.** Vendored from gstack (MIT, (c) Garry Tan, https://github.com/garrytan/gstack @ a3259400). The upstream Claude-Code-specific boilerplate (telemetry, session tracking, update checks, plan-mode hooks, learnings/brain sync) was removed; the workflow itself is unchanged. Paths below are relative to this skill's directory; sibling skills live at `../<id>/` (ids are prefixed `gstack-`). `$GSTACK_ROOT` is an optional upstream gstack install (default `~/.claude/skills/gstack`) needed only for optional helpers such as the `browse` binary; skip any step that needs it when it is absent. "Ask the user" means a plain chat question when no structured question tool exists.

## When to invoke this skill

Analyzes commit history, work patterns,
and code quality metrics with persistent history and trend tracking.
Team-aware: breaks down per-person contributions with praise and growth areas.
Use when asked to "weekly retro", "what did we ship", or "engineering retrospective".
Proactively suggest at the end of a work week or sprint.

## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First, detect the git hosting platform from the remote URL:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no
PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

**If GitHub:**
1. `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` — if succeeds, use it
2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` — if succeeds, use it

**If GitLab:**
1. `glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `target_branch` field — if succeeds, use it
2. `glab repo view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `default_branch` field — if succeeds, use it

**Git-native fallback (if unknown platform, or CLI commands fail):**
1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
2. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null` → use `main`
3. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null` → use `master`

If all fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch" or `<default>`.

# /retro — Weekly Engineering Retrospective

Generates a comprehensive engineering retrospective analyzing commit history, work patterns, and code quality metrics. Team-aware: identifies the user running the command, then analyzes every contributor with per-person praise and growth opportunities. Designed for a senior IC/CTO-level builder using Claude Code as a force multiplier.

## User-invocable
When the user types `/retro`, run this skill.

## Arguments
- `/retro` — default: last 7 days
- `/retro 24h` — last 24 hours
- `/retro 14d` — last 14 days
- `/retro 30d` — last 30 days
- `/retro compare` — compare current window vs prior same-length window
- `/retro compare 14d` — compare with explicit window
- `/retro global` — cross-project retro across all AI coding tools (7d default)
- `/retro global 14d` — cross-project retro with explicit window


## Instructions

Parse the argument to determine the time window. Default to 7 days if no argument given. All times should be reported in the user's **local timezone** (use the system default — do NOT set `TZ`).

**Midnight-aligned windows:** For day (`d`) and week (`w`) units, compute an absolute start date at local midnight, not a relative string. For example, if today is 2026-03-18 and the window is 7 days: the start date is 2026-03-11. Use `--since="2026-03-11T00:00:00"` for git log queries — the explicit `T00:00:00` suffix ensures git starts from midnight. Without it, git uses the current wall-clock time (e.g., `--since="2026-03-11"` at 11pm means 11pm, not midnight). For week units, multiply by 7 to get days (e.g., `2w` = 14 days back). For hour (`h`) units, use `--since="N hours ago"` since midnight alignment does not apply to sub-day windows.

**Argument validation:** If the argument doesn't match a number followed by `d`, `h`, or `w`, the word `compare` (optionally followed by a window), or the word `global` (optionally followed by a window), show this usage and stop:
```
Usage: /retro [window | compare | global]
  /retro              — last 7 days (default)
  /retro 24h          — last 24 hours
  /retro 14d          — last 14 days
  /retro 30d          — last 30 days
  /retro compare      — compare this period vs prior period
  /retro compare 14d  — compare with explicit window
  /retro global       — cross-project retro across all AI tools (7d default)
  /retro global 14d   — cross-project retro with explicit window
```

**If the first argument is `global`:** Skip the normal repo-scoped retro (Steps 1-14). Instead, follow the **Global Retrospective** flow at the end of this document. The optional second argument is the time window (default 7d). This mode does NOT require being inside a git repo.

## Engineering Retro: [date range]

### Summary Table
(from Step 2)

### Trends vs Last Retro
(from Step 11, loaded before save — skip if first retro)

### Time & Session Patterns
(from Steps 3-4)

Narrative interpreting what the team-wide patterns mean:
- When the most productive hours are and what drives them
- Whether sessions are getting longer or shorter over time
- Estimated hours per day of active coding (team aggregate)
- Notable patterns: do team members code at the same time or in shifts?

### Shipping Velocity
(from Steps 5-7)

Narrative covering:
- Commit type mix and what it reveals
- PR size distribution and what it reveals about shipping cadence
- Fix-chain detection (sequences of fix commits on the same subsystem)
- Version bump discipline

### Code Quality Signals
- Test LOC ratio trend
- Hotspot analysis (are the same files churning?)
- Greptile signal ratio and trend (if history exists): "Greptile: X% signal (Y valid catches, Z false positives)"

### Test Health
- Total test files: N (from command 10)
- Tests added this period: M (from command 12 — test files changed)
- Regression test commits: list `test(qa):` and `test(design):` and `test: coverage` commits from command 11
- If prior retro exists and has `test_health`: show delta "Test count: {last} → {now} (+{delta})"
- If test ratio < 20%: flag as growth area — "100% test coverage is the goal. Tests make vibe coding safe."

### Plan Completion
Check review JSONL logs for plan completion data from /ship runs this period:

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
eval "$($GSTACK_ROOT/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
cat ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/*-reviews.jsonl 2>/dev/null | grep '"skill":"ship"' | grep '"plan_items_total"' || echo "NO_PLAN_DATA"
```

If plan completion data exists within the retro time window:
- Count branches shipped with plans (entries that have `plan_items_total` > 0)
- Compute average completion: sum of `plan_items_done` / sum of `plan_items_total`
- Identify most-skipped item category if data supports it

Output:
```
Plan Completion This Period:
  {N} branches shipped with plans
  Average completion: {X}% ({done}/{total} items)
```

If no plan data exists, skip this section silently.

### Focus & Highlights
(from Step 8)
- Focus score with interpretation
- Ship of the week callout

### Your Week (personal deep-dive)
(from Step 9, for the current user only)

This is the section the user cares most about. Include:
- Their personal commit count, LOC, test ratio
- Their session patterns and peak hours
- Their focus areas
- Their biggest ship
- **What you did well** (2-3 specific things anchored in commits)
- **Where to level up** (1-2 specific, actionable suggestions)

### Team Breakdown
(from Step 9, for each teammate — skip if solo repo)

For each teammate (sorted by commits descending), write a section:

#### [Name]
- **What they shipped**: 2-3 sentences on their contributions, areas of focus, and commit patterns
- **Praise**: 1-2 specific things they did well, anchored in actual commits. Be genuine — what would you actually say in a 1:1? Examples:
  - "Cleaned up the entire auth module in 3 small, reviewable PRs — textbook decomposition"
  - "Added integration tests for every new endpoint, not just happy paths"
  - "Fixed the N+1 query that was causing 2s load times on the dashboard"
- **Opportunity for growth**: 1 specific, constructive suggestion. Frame as investment, not criticism. Examples:
  - "Test coverage on the payment module is at 8% — worth investing in before the next feature lands on top of it"
  - "Most commits land in a single burst — spacing work across the day could reduce context-switching fatigue"
  - "All commits land between 1-4am — sustainable pace matters for code quality long-term"

**AI collaboration note:** If many commits have `Co-Authored-By` AI trailers (e.g., Claude, Copilot), note the AI-assisted commit percentage as a team metric. Frame it neutrally — "N% of commits were AI-assisted" — without judgment.

### Top 3 Team Wins
Identify the 3 highest-impact things shipped in the window across the whole team. For each:
- What it was
- Who shipped it
- Why it matters (product/architecture impact)

### 3 Things to Improve
Specific, actionable, anchored in actual commits. Mix personal and team-level suggestions. Phrase as "to get even better, the team could..."

### 3 Habits for Next Week
Small, practical, realistic. Each must be something that takes <5 minutes to adopt. At least one should be team-oriented (e.g., "review each other's PRs same-day").

### Week-over-Week Trends
(if applicable, from Step 10)

---

## Global Retrospective Mode

When the user runs `/retro global` (or `/retro global 14d`), follow this flow instead of the repo-scoped Steps 1-14. This mode works from any directory — it does NOT require being inside a git repo.

### Global Step 1: Compute time window

Same midnight-aligned logic as the regular retro. Default 7d. The second argument after `global` is the window (e.g., `14d`, `30d`, `24h`).

### Global Step 2: Run discovery

Locate and run the discovery script using this fallback chain:

```bash
DISCOVER_BIN=""
[ -x $GSTACK_ROOT/bin/gstack-global-discover ] && DISCOVER_BIN=$GSTACK_ROOT/bin/gstack-global-discover
[ -z "$DISCOVER_BIN" ] && [ -x $GSTACK_ROOT/bin/gstack-global-discover ] && DISCOVER_BIN=$GSTACK_ROOT/bin/gstack-global-discover
[ -z "$DISCOVER_BIN" ] && which gstack-global-discover >/dev/null 2>&1 && DISCOVER_BIN=$(which gstack-global-discover)
[ -z "$DISCOVER_BIN" ] && [ -f bin/gstack-global-discover.ts ] && DISCOVER_BIN="bun run bin/gstack-global-discover.ts"
echo "DISCOVER_BIN: $DISCOVER_BIN"
```

If no binary is found, tell the user: "Discovery script not found. Run `bun run build` in the gstack directory to compile it." and stop.

Run the discovery:
```bash
$DISCOVER_BIN --since "<window>" --format json 2>/tmp/gstack-discover-stderr
```

Read the stderr output from `/tmp/gstack-discover-stderr` for diagnostic info. Parse the JSON output from stdout.

If `total_sessions` is 0, say: "No AI coding sessions found in the last <window>. Try a longer window: `/retro global 30d`" and stop.

### Global Step 3: Run git log on each discovered repo

For each repo in the discovery JSON's `repos` array, find the first valid path in `paths[]` (directory exists with `.git/`). If no valid path exists, skip the repo and note it.

**For local-only repos** (where `remote` starts with `local:`): skip `git fetch` and use the local default branch. Use `git log HEAD` instead of `git log origin/$DEFAULT`.

**For repos with remotes:**

```bash
git -C <path> fetch origin --quiet 2>/dev/null
```

Detect the default branch for each repo: first try `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, then check common branch names (`main`, `master`), then fall back to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. Use the detected branch as `<default>` in the commands below.

```bash
# Commits with stats
git -C <path> log origin/$DEFAULT --since="<start_date>T00:00:00" --format="%H|%aN|%ai|%s" --shortstat

# Commit timestamps for session detection, streak, and context switching
git -C <path> log origin/$DEFAULT --since="<start_date>T00:00:00" --format="%at|%aN|%ai|%s" | sort -n

# Per-author commit counts
git -C <path> shortlog origin/$DEFAULT --since="<start_date>T00:00:00" -sn --no-merges

# PR/MR numbers from commit messages (GitHub #NNN, GitLab !NNN)
git -C <path> log origin/$DEFAULT --since="<start_date>T00:00:00" --format="%s" | grep -oE '[#!][0-9]+' | sort -t'#' -k1 | uniq
```

For repos that fail (deleted paths, network errors): skip and note "N repos could not be reached."

### Global Step 4: Compute global shipping streak

For each repo, get commit dates (capped at 365 days):

```bash
git -C <path> log origin/$DEFAULT --since="365 days ago" --format="%ad" --date=format:"%Y-%m-%d" | sort -u
```

Union all dates across all repos. Count backward from today — how many consecutive days have at least one commit to ANY repo? If the streak hits 365 days, display as "365+ days".

### Global Step 5: Compute context switching metric

From the commit timestamps gathered in Step 3, group by date. For each date, count how many distinct repos had commits that day. Report:
- Average repos/day
- Maximum repos/day
- Which days were focused (1 repo) vs. fragmented (3+ repos)

### Global Step 6: Per-tool productivity patterns

From the discovery JSON, analyze tool usage patterns:
- Which AI tool is used for which repos (exclusive vs. shared)
- Session count per tool
- Behavioral patterns (e.g., "Codex used exclusively for myapp, Claude Code for everything else")

### Global Step 7: Aggregate and generate narrative

Structure the output with the **shareable personal card first**, then the full
team/project breakdown below. The personal card is designed to be screenshot-friendly
— everything someone would want to share on X/Twitter in one clean block.

---

**Tweetable summary** (first line, before everything else):
```
Week of Mar 14: 5 projects, 138 commits, 250k LOC across 5 repos | 48 AI sessions | Streak: 52d 🔥
```

## 🚀 Your Week: [user name] — [date range]

This section is the **shareable personal card**. It contains ONLY the current user's
stats — no team data, no project breakdowns. Designed to screenshot and post.

Use the user identity from `git config user.name` to filter all per-repo git data.
Aggregate across all repos to compute personal totals.

Render as a single visually clean block. Left border only — no right border (LLMs
can't align right borders reliably). Pad repo names to the longest name so columns
align cleanly. Never truncate project names.

```

```

**Rules for the personal card:**
- Only show repos where the user has commits. Skip repos with 0 commits.
- Sort repos by user's commit count descending.
- **Never truncate repo names.** Use the full repo name (e.g., `analyze_transcripts`
  not `analyze_trans`). Pad the name column to the longest repo name so all columns
  align. If names are long, widen the box — the box width adapts to content.
- For LOC, use "k" formatting for thousands (e.g., "+64.0k" not "+64010").
- Role: "solo" if user is the only contributor, "team" if others contributed.
- Ship of the Week: the user's single highest-LOC PR across ALL repos.
- Top Work: 3 bullet points summarizing the user's major themes, inferred from
  commit messages. Not individual commits — synthesize into themes.
  E.g., "Built /retro global — cross-project retrospective with AI session discovery"
  not "feat: gstack-global-discover" + "feat: /retro global template".
- The card must be self-contained. Someone seeing ONLY this block should understand
  the user's week without any surrounding context.
- Do NOT include team members, project totals, or context switching data here.

**Personal streak:** Use the user's own commits across all repos (filtered by
`--author`) to compute a personal streak, separate from the team streak.

---

## Global Engineering Retro: [date range]

Everything below is the full analysis — team data, project breakdowns, patterns.
This is the "deep dive" that follows the shareable card.

### All Projects Overview
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Projects active | N |
| Total commits (all repos, all contributors) | N |
| Total LOC | +N / -N |
| AI coding sessions | N (CC: X, Codex: Y, Gemini: Z) |
| Active days | N |
| Global shipping streak (any contributor, any repo) | N consecutive days |
| Context switches/day | N avg (max: M) |

### Per-Project Breakdown
For each repo (sorted by commits descending):
- Repo name (with % of total commits)
- Commits, LOC, PRs merged, top contributor
- Key work (inferred from commit messages)
- AI sessions by tool

**Your Contributions** (sub-section within each project):
For each project, add a "Your contributions" block showing the current user's
personal stats within that repo. Use the user identity from `git config user.name`
to filter. Include:
- Your commits / total commits (with %)
- Your LOC (+insertions / -deletions)
- Your key work (inferred from YOUR commit messages only)
- Your commit type mix (feat/fix/refactor/chore/docs breakdown)
- Your biggest ship in this repo (highest-LOC commit or PR)

If the user is the only contributor, say "Solo project — all commits are yours."
If the user has 0 commits in a repo (team project they didn't touch this period),
say "No commits this period — [N] AI sessions only." and skip the breakdown.

Format:
```
**Your contributions:** 47/244 commits (19%), +4.2k/-0.3k LOC
  Key work: Writer Chat, email blocking, security hardening
  Biggest ship: PR #605 — Writer Chat eats the admin bar (2,457 ins, 46 files)
  Mix: feat(3) fix(2) chore(1)
```

### Cross-Project Patterns
- Time allocation across projects (% breakdown, use YOUR commits not total)
- Peak productivity hours aggregated across all repos
- Focused vs. fragmented days
- Context switching trends

### Tool Usage Analysis
Per-tool breakdown with behavioral patterns:
- Claude Code: N sessions across M repos — patterns observed
- Codex: N sessions across M repos — patterns observed
- Gemini: N sessions across M repos — patterns observed

### Ship of the Week (Global)
Highest-impact PR across ALL projects. Identify by LOC and commit messages.

### 3 Cross-Project Insights
What the global view reveals that no single-repo retro could show.

### 3 Habits for Next Week
Considering the full cross-project picture.

---

### Global Step 8: Load history & compare

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
ls -t ~/.gstack/retros/global-*.json 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

**Only compare against a prior retro with the same `window` value** (e.g., 7d vs 7d). If the most recent prior retro has a different window, skip comparison and note: "Prior global retro used a different window — skipping comparison."

If a matching prior retro exists, load it with the Read tool. Show a **Trends vs Last Global Retro** table with deltas for key metrics: total commits, LOC, sessions, streak, context switches/day.

If no prior global retros exist, append: "First global retro recorded — run again next week to see trends."

### Global Step 9: Save snapshot

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/retros
```

Determine the next sequence number for today:
```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
today=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
existing=$(ls ~/.gstack/retros/global-${today}-*.json 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
next=$((existing + 1))
```

Use the Write tool to save JSON to `~/.gstack/retros/global-${today}-${next}.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "global",
  "date": "2026-03-21",
  "window": "7d",
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "gstack",
      "remote": "<detected from git remote get-url origin, normalized to HTTPS>",
      "commits": 47,
      "insertions": 3200,
      "deletions": 800,
      "sessions": { "claude_code": 15, "codex": 3, "gemini": 0 }
    }
  ],
  "totals": {
    "commits": 182,
    "insertions": 15300,
    "deletions": 4200,
    "projects": 5,
    "active_days": 6,
    "sessions": { "claude_code": 48, "codex": 8, "gemini": 3 },
    "global_streak_days": 52,
    "avg_context_switches_per_day": 2.1
  },
  "tweetable": "Week of Mar 14: 5 projects, 182 commits, 15.3k LOC | CC: 48, Codex: 8, Gemini: 3 | Focus: gstack (58%) | Streak: 52d"
}
```

---

## Compare Mode

When the user runs `/retro compare` (or `/retro compare 14d`):

1. Compute metrics for the current window (default 7d) using the midnight-aligned start date (same logic as the main retro — e.g., if today is 2026-03-18 and window is 7d, use `--since="2026-03-11T00:00:00"`)
2. Compute metrics for the immediately prior same-length window using both `--since` and `--until` with midnight-aligned dates to avoid overlap (e.g., for a 7d window starting 2026-03-11: prior window is `--since="2026-03-04T00:00:00" --until="2026-03-11T00:00:00"`)
3. Show a side-by-side comparison table with deltas and arrows
4. Write a brief narrative highlighting the biggest improvements and regressions
5. Save only the current-window snapshot to `.context/retros/` (same as a normal retro run); do **not** persist the prior-window metrics.

## Tone

- Encouraging but candid, no coddling
- Specific and concrete — always anchor in actual commits/code
- Skip generic praise ("great job!") — say exactly what was good and why
- Frame improvements as leveling up, not criticism
- **Praise should feel like something you'd actually say in a 1:1** — specific, earned, genuine
- **Growth suggestions should feel like investment advice** — "this is worth your time because..." not "you failed at..."
- Never compare teammates against each other negatively. Each person's section stands on its own.
- Keep total output around 3000-4500 words (slightly longer to accommodate team sections)
- Use markdown tables and code blocks for data, prose for narrative
- Output directly to the conversation — do NOT write to filesystem (except the `.context/retros/` JSON snapshot)

## Important Rules

- ALL narrative output goes directly to the user in the conversation. The ONLY file written is the `.context/retros/` JSON snapshot.
- Use `origin/<default>` for all git queries (not local main which may be stale)
- Display all timestamps in the user's local timezone (do not override `TZ`)
- If the window has zero commits, say so and suggest a different window
- Round LOC/hour to nearest 50
- Treat merge commits as PR boundaries
- Do not read CLAUDE.md or other docs — this skill is self-contained
- On first run (no prior retros), skip comparison sections gracefully
- **Global mode:** Does NOT require being inside a git repo. Saves snapshots to `~/.gstack/retros/` (not `.context/retros/`). Gracefully skip AI tools that aren't installed. Only compare against prior global retros with the same window value. If streak hits 365d cap, display as "365+ days".
